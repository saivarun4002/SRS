"Software Requirements Specification for IUfA's Unified University Inventory System (UUIS)

1. Introduction
1.1 PurposeThis document describes the Unified University Inventory System (UUIS) to provide a secure, web-based solution for managing inventory across multiple faculties within the university. It outlines the business and functional requirements for integrating three faculty databases into a unified system.
1.2 Document Conventions
Use of technical terminology is minimized for broader audience comprehension.
Use cases are structured as per standard software engineering practices.
1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
Audience: Developers, IT administrators, project managers, and end-users (faculty and department administrators).
Suggestion: Start with the System Description for an overview, then delve into Functional Requirements and Use Cases based on your role.
1.4 Project ScopeThe UUIS facilitates:
Managing inventory assets (e.g., rooms, software licenses, and equipment).
Handling administrative tasks such as transferring, editing, and approving asset-related requests.
Providing role-based permissions for secure operations.
Offering report generation and advanced search functionalities.
1.5 References

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product PerspectiveUUIS is a centralized, web-based inventory system designed to integrate databases from three faculties and enable secure inventory management.
2.2 Product Features
Inventory Management: Add, edit, modify, and transfer assets.
Authentication and Permissions: Role-based access control with customizable permissions.
Report Generation: Asset reports, user permissions, and request tracking.
Search Functionality: Basic and advanced search capabilities.
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
University Administrators: Manage assets across all faculties.
Faculty Administrators: Handle faculty-level inventory.
Department Administrators: Oversee departmental assets.
IT Team: Maintain servers and assign permissions.
End Users: Students and professors with limited request permissions.
2.4 Operating Environment
Platforms: Compatible with Microsoft and Unix systems.
Browsers: Supported on IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari.
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Users are familiar with basic web applications.
The system will be accessible during working hours, with maintenance performed during off-hours.

3. System Features
3.1 Feature: Inventory ManagementPriority: HighDescription: Manage inventory assets, including adding, editing, transferring, and approving requests.
Stimulus/Response Sequence:
User initiates an inventory action (e.g., add or transfer).
System validates input and permissions.
System updates the database and notifies relevant users.
Functional Requirements:
Assets must be grouped into categories: rooms, licenses, and equipment.
Permissions determine asset visibility and modifiability.
3.2 Feature: Authentication and PermissionsPriority: HighDescription: Role-based authentication ensures secure access and allows permission delegation.
Stimulus/Response Sequence:
User logs in using credentials.
System verifies role and grants appropriate access.
Functional Requirements:
Level-based permission structure (e.g., department, faculty, and university).
IT administrators can customize permissions.
3.3 Feature: Report GenerationPriority: MediumDescription: Generate reports on inventory, user permissions, and requests.
Stimulus/Response Sequence:
User selects report type (e.g., Asset by Location).
System fetches and displays the report.
Functional Requirements:
Reports must be filterable and sortable.
Advanced users can generate custom reports.

4. External Interface Requirements
4.1 User Interfaces
Dashboard: Displays pending requests, asset statuses, and reports.
Login Page: For user authentication.
4.2 Hardware Interfaces
Servers must support high-performance database operations.
4.3 Software Interfaces
Database: Centralized SQL database for asset and user management.
Web Server: Handles authentication and request processing.
4.4 Communication Interfaces
Email notifications for request approvals and asset transfers.

5. Nonfunctional Requirements
5.1 Usability
Learning curve: 2–4 hours.
Consistent terminology for intuitive navigation.
5.2 Availability
UUIS will be available during working hours with 99.99% uptime.
5.3 Security
Authentication through username and password.
Periodic backups and IP-based query limits.
5.4 Maintainability
Modular design for easy upgrades and debugging.","@startuml
